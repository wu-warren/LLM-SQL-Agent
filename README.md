## Dataset
This project uses the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist (Kaggle).
The schema is derived directly from the CSV files and the official relationship diagram,
with explicit modeling of table grain, primary keys, and foreign keys to support
multi-table SQL generation and error analysis.
